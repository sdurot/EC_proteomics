# EC_proteomics

This is a short and simple python code to analyze proteomics data and create plots as it was done for the publication "Multi-omics analysis of endothelial cells reveals the metabolic diversity that underlies endothelial cell functions" on bioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.03.641143).
The code was written a couple of years ago and could be improved but it should be enough to enable anyone to analyze the proteomics data. There is much more that can be done with the data (network analyis: heat diffusion, RWR, or TF activity prediction), which is not part of the publication and therefore not in the code.

Have fun!
